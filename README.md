In this project, I built a machine learning model to predict whether a person has diabetes based on various health-related features. As part of the Digital Skill Fair 35.0 â€“ Data Science Bootcamp by dibimbing.id, I used a Decision Tree algorithm in Python to classify diabetes cases. The model categorizes data from a diabetes dataset consisting of 442 rows and 10 columns, which includes features such as age, sex, BMI, blood pressure, and other medical-related variables. The target variable, 'diabetes_progression', is a continuous numerical value that indicates the progression of diabetes.

The dataset undergoes thorough preprocessing, including checks for missing values, which confirmed that the data is clean and ready for analysis. Exploratory data analysis is performed using boxplots to visualize the distribution of key features and identify potential outliers. A Decision Tree Classifier is selected for model training, with the dataset split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets to evaluate performance. The model's accuracy is assessed using the accuracy_score function, and predictions are made on the test set. The trained decision tree model is visualized to provide a clear representation of its structure and decision-making process.

Overall, this project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques in healthcare, offering valuable insights for better understanding and managing diabetes in patients. Future work may involve exploring other classification algorithms, hyperparameter tuning, and incorporating additional features to enhance model performance.
